      Calculators have not only greatly enhanced our ability to perform the
      regular computations that are involved in everyday life, but provided humans
      with the ability to understand mathematics on a greater scale than ever imagined.
      Calculations which were previously cumbersome and time-consuming can now be done
      in minutes or even seconds,
      all at the push of a few buttons.
